This course aims to study economic models and understand their foundations based on computational applications developed in **Julia**. The approach is practical: start with an economic problem, select an appropriate numerical technique to analyze it, apply the technique to the problem, and present the findings.
The webpage of the course is (here)[https://felixordonez.github.io/ComputationalEconomicsJulia/intro.html]

    ```julia
    print("Hello world")
    ```
